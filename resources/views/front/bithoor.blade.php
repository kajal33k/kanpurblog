                        <p class="text-gray-700">According to Hindu scriptures, Brahma performed penance here before creating the universe. Brahmavart Ghat, which is still present today, is a significant site where hundreds of people come daily for darshan (spiritual visit).</p>
                        <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">It is also believed that Dhruv performed penance here for Lord Vishnu.

                        <p class="text-gray-700">Bithoor has a profound connection with the Indian freedom struggle and movements. The first war of Indian independence, which began in 1857, started here in Bithoor. Located 17 kilometers from Kanpur on the Kannauj Road, Bithoor is a small town by the Ganges River that once served as a center of power.</p>
                        <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">Today, the old historical buildings, including Baradari and temples, stand in a dilapidated condition. However, the local residents preserve the memories of this historical period, which are taught in schools across the country. Bithoor's role in the struggle for independence remains a significant part of its heritage.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">Bithoor played an unparalleled role in India's struggle for independence. The first spark of the 1857 revolt was ignited here. This town was the land of figures like Nana Rao and Tatya Tope. The Tope family has descendants still residing in Barrackpore, and Jhansi’s Rani Lakshmi Bai spent her childhood here. During that period, the British soldiers fleeing Kanpur were executed at Sati Chaura Ghat.</p>
                        <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">In retaliation, the British destroyed entire villages and hanged people from trees. After their victory, the British demolished Nana Rao Peshwa’s palace in Bithoor. When Tatya Tope's relatives were released from Gwalior Jail in 1860, they returned to find their homes had been burned down.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">At the site of the flagpole established by Baba Raghav Das in Bithoor, plans for the rebellion that was sparked in Kanpur were once made. The stone at the flagpole site bears witness to the meetings held by Nana Saheb Peshwa, Tatya Tope, Azimulla Khan, and Rao Saheb. From here, the message of organizing armed revolution across the country was sent out.</p>
                        <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">There is an old well in Nana's fort, and legend has it that this well supplied water to Nana’s army. Upon entering Bithoor, you can find the "Swarg Ki Sidhi" at Valmiki Ashram. This tower, with 365 niches corresponding to the days of the year, was used by revolutionaries to keep watch over Bithoor and the Ganges, observing British activities. Each niche would have a lamp lit daily to keep track of the day.</p>
