                Kanpur earned the nickname "Manchester of India" during the British colonial period due to its booming textile industry, much like Manchester in England, which was renowned for its cotton mills. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Kanpur was a major hub for cotton and woolen textiles. The city’s industrial infrastructure, including numerous mills and factories, mirrored the textile boom that Manchester experienced during the Industrial Revolution.
